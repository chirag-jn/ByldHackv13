# HeyPy

## Idea

- An app which provides you python code for the pseudo code you speak.
- Provides users a handy tool for writing hundreds of lines of code in just few minutes.
- Programmed with easy and informal voice commands.

## Technology Stack

- Python 
- Watson Speech to Text API
- Wit.ai

## How is our project helpful?

Reduces time wasted on debugging syntax errors
Speeds up the process of coding
Saves time for searching code on StackOverflow, Codota

## Future Plans

- Use Natural Language Processing for more accuracy in converting speech to text.
- Provide code implementations in other programming languages
- Code optimization and suggest more efficient algorithms of pseudo-code to users.
- Simultaneous error checking and prompts.
- Allow users to edit and delete code blocks.

## Implementation

- Voice from microphone converted to text using Watson Speech To Text.
- Errors removed from text using Wit.Ai
- Parsed operators and numbers to mathematical terms 
- Converted pseudo code to python code
